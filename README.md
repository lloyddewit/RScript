RScript library
========================

## Overview
This library parses script written in the R programming language and creates a VB.net recursive object model of the R statements and their components. The object model can be easily analyzed and updated within the VB.net environment. If needed, the library can also generate new R script from an updated model.
This library has potential applications within R editors, R formatters, R GUI builders and R static analysis tools. For an example of this library in use, please see [R-Instat](https://github.com/africanmathsinitiative/R-Instat).
